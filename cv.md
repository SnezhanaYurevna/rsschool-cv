About 
I'm working as a teacher of English but I know that I want to grow, to develop in another sphare. Iwant to be a programmer. No, I want to become a good programme. I chose testing as I believe that itâ€™s the key to
high quality. I believe I have traits of charactersand skills necessary to gain this quality such as attention to details,craving for getting to the bottom of the problem. I studied at several Online courses related to testing and, of course, I am
studying by myself now. I am ready to work hard and productively and open to new knowledge.
